In this project, we're creating an Image Carousel.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this might be a great way to push yourself.

Users should be able to: 

- Toggle left and right through the image thumbnails
- Click an image to select it manually
