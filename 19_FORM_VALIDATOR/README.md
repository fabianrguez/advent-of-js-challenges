# Form Validator

## Brief

In this project, we're creating a Form Validator.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this might be a great way to push yourself.


### Users should be able to: 

- When the user unfocuses a field, the form should perform a validation check
- All the fields are required
- Should enter a properly formatted email address
- The password and confirm password fields should match
- Clicking on the show / hide button on the password field should change the visibility of the password (simply change the input `type` from `password` to `text` or vice versa)

## Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework like React, Vue, or Svelte. Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla JavaScript.
- Take a step back and try writing the HTML and CSS for this project yourself. Start with the provided Figma file.
