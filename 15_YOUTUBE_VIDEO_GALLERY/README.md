In this project, we're creating a YouTube Video Gallery.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this might be a great way to push yourself.


### Users should be able to: 

- View title, description, and embed of featured video from the channel
- View gallery of title and thumbnails for other videos

## Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework like React, Vue, or Svelte. Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla JavaScript.
- Take a step back and try writing the HTML and CSS for this project yourself. Start with the provided Figma file.
