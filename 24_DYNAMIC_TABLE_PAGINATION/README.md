 # Dynamic Table Pagination

## Brief 

In this project, we're creating a Dynamic Table with Pagination.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this might be a great way to push yourself.

### Users should be able to: 

- Display 10 entries of data preloaded into **app.js**
-Sort columns ascending or descending by ID, Name, Email Address, and Job Title
- When sorting ascending the top arrow in the table header will be a darker blue and the bottom arrow will be a lighter blue. You can update the style by adding a class of `ascending` to the `button`. See line 22 in the index.html starter file as an example.
- When sorting descending the bottom arrow in the table header will be a dark blue and the top arrow will be a lighter blue. You can update the style by adding a class of `descending` to the `button`.
- Users can view the next page of data (if you’re not on the last page already) by clicking on the next arrow (bottom right).
- Users can view the previous page of data (if you’re not on the first page) by clicking on the previous arrow (bottom right).
