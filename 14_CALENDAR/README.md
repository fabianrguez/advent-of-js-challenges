In this project, we're creating a Calendar Viewer.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this might be a great way to push yourself.

Users should be able to:
- View calendar with correct days with the current day highlighted.
- Navigate through different months.
