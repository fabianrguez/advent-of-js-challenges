# Star Rating

## Brief
In this project, we're creating a Star Rating.

![Project Image](https://coachtestprep.s3.amazonaws.com/direct-uploads/user-117025/f3e4f667-a29d-4c72-82ea-c74486c1f4ef/CleanShot%202021-12-16%20at%2008.14.57.png)

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this might be a great way to push yourself.


### Users should be able to: 

- Hover to select a star rating

## Taking your Project to the Next Level
- Use a framework like React, Vue, or Svelte. Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla JavaScript.
- Take a step back and try writing the HTML and CSS for this project yourself. Start with the provided Figma file. If you get stuck, you can always purchase the Advent of CSS solutions, where Amy explains how to build this.
